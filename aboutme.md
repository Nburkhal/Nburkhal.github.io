subtitle: Translating Data into Compelling Stories & Insights

Language is the foundation of it all.

I never realized my passion for language would transfer to the data science field. I had always hoped to use my marketing
degree and language certifications to work on some international marketing campaigns. Working as a freelance Japanese-to-
English translator while in the Air Force, I tried to polish my language skills to perfection before my contract ended, and
took every business and legal translation job I could find. But it felt meh. I yearned for more. I wanted to learn more, to
learn something different.

Then my wife showed me a HackerEarth YouTube video on what data scientists are, and the problems they work on. I was instantly
hooked. And since then, I've immersed myself in data - python, software engineering, data analysis, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, neural networks, big data, cloud servers, SQL, NoSQL, AWS, linear algebra, statistics, calculus - all
of which call to my passions. Data science incorporates creativity and problem-solving, and I'm allowed to tinker with models
and research their underlying mathematical foundations to make them work better. I can break things to improve them!

I love translating data into compelling narratives and insights. In a way, it reminds me of translating a really good Japanese
story into English. Both raw data and heavy Japanese seem intimidating at first, but once you understand the basic underlying
structures, the story begins to unfold right before your eyes.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills, problem solving, working well under pressure, leadership, data exploration
& visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, data engineering, deep learning, and neural networks. So far I have 
Python, Pandas, HTML, Numpy, SQL, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-learn, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically
grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
